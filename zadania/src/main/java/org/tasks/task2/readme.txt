In this task you are given two classes - Cargo and Unit. In the Unit class (representing for ex. ship),
there is a field that stores a list of cargo. Also, there is a bunch of methods that allow you to add, remove and
,manage the cargo.

However, we have some problems with the code. Some programmers wrote tests for the code that seems
 wrong - the tests are failing.

Your task is to fix the code so the tests are passing. You can't change the
logic of the tests. But it may be necessary to split some tested methods into smaller ones - different tests to get everything working.
Also, consider changing names of the test to make them more descriptive -
they may be wrong / misleading after splitting the methods.

IMPORTANT -> YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE ASSERTIONS IN THE TEST, YOU CAN ONLY SPLIT THEM INTO DIFFERENT TESTS TO GET
PROPER LOGIC. REMEMBER TO RENAME TESTS - OTHER PROGRAMMERS SHOULD KNOW WHAT IS BEING TESTED.
