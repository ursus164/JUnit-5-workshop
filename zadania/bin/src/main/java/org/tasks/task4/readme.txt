Given class represents an GradeBook, which is used to manage subjects and their corresponding grades. Here is what each method does:

- addSubject: Adds a new subject to the grade book.
- getSubject: Retrieves the subject object corresponding to the given subject name.
- addNote: Adds a grade (note) to the specified subject. It retrieves the subject object using the getSubject method and adds the note to it.
- getAverageNote: Calculates and returns the average grade across all subjects in the grade book

In package "test/java/org/tasks/task4" you will find a test class with initial tests.
However, some of them ends in failure. Get familiar with the structure and methods of "GradeBook" and "Subject" classes provided
in this package and then navigate to the corresponding test class in "test/java/org/tasks/task4" for the rest of the task.
