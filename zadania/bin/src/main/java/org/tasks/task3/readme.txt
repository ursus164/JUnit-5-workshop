You are given the Order class. An order object contains a list of Meal class objects.
Order class provides methods to add meal to the order, remove the meal from the order,
retrieve the list of meals in the order, calculate the total price of the order,
and cancel the order.

In package "test/java/org/tasks/task3" you will find a test class with initial tests for this class.
Your task will be to refactor code in the class OrderTest to make it better and clearer.

You can now get familiar with provided classes and then navigate to readme file in the "test/java/org/tasks/task3" package :)
