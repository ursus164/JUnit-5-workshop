Dear Student,
You are provided with 5 simple tasks to complete. Tasks are based on real-life classes taken from bigger projects.
Their main focus is to help you understand how the unit-testing works. You will get familiar with good practises of
writing unit-tests, creating proper and informative names for tests, and finally how to write a good test,
and debug errors.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. Good luck!
